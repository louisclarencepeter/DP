Greeting and Introduction:
Hello! Welcome to Destination Paradise Zanzibar. How can I assist you with planning your trip to Zanzibar today?

Initial Question:
Could you please tell me where you are staying in Zanzibar? This will help me suggest the best excursions and activities near your location.

Safari Inquiries:

I want to make a safari:
That's great to hear! For safari experiences, you'll need to travel to the mainland of Tanzania. Zanzibar itself doesn’t offer safari experiences, but nearby mainland destinations like Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater are incredible options. Let me know your preferences so I can help you plan the perfect safari adventure.

In Tanzania, how can I book it?
